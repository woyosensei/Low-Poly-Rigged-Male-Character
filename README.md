# Low-Poly-Rigged-Male-Character
Low poly model made in Blender 3.3.1, rigged with named bones, face painted (no textures), ready to animate.

Low poly character made in Blender for those who are too busy, lazy :P or those who just want to skip all the steps making one and go to animating this thing straight away. I do realise it's not a perfect but it does the job for me and my projects pretty well, so I've diecided to share it.
Hope you like it. Enjoy.
